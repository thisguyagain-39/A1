        <h2> 3. We follow the regulations of the governments we operate under. </h2>
    
        <div class="accobody">
    
            <p> We ensure that we are compliant to any and all laws in the governments under which we operate. </p>
    
            <p> Recently, the S7RC and S7SAZ's vast government overreach has made this more difficult in Sector 7, but we continue to comply to their authoritarian rules as STARLINE SECTOR 7*. </p>

            <p> The S7RC's External Corporations and Fair Labour Practices Act and External Corporations and Citizen's Privacy Act continue to expand their reach into STARLINE's external operations. We encourage all customers in Sector 7 to leave the sector to continue receiving the best services from STARLINE Industries. </p>
