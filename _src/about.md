# About STARLINE

## Who We Are

STARLINE Industries is a multisectoral conglomerate based in the Outer Union.

STARLINE Industries originally began as a transit, charter and freight company in the 14th Universal Galactic Cycle on Planet 4. We made funds primarily by assisting Outer Union agents in discovering new habitable planets and transporting colonists between early OU colonies. 

STARLINE's first major expansion was its acquisition of Seventh Sail Ships in the 16th UGC, allowing STARLINE to develop its own frieghter and charter ship models early on in it's lifespan, occasionally selling these ships to individuals. 

Since then, STARLINE has expanded into weaponry, banking, clothing, internet services, education, entertainment, prison management, and government services in the Outer Union. 

We operate many subsidary companies in many locations. For a full list of all our products and services, see <a href="../products/index.html"> Full List of Products and Services </a>
