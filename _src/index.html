            Q: Where does STARLINE Industries operate?

            </p>

            <p class="a">

                A: STARLINE Industries operates in the following regions:

            </p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Sectors Three and Six</li>

                    <li>Regions of space under the control of the Center Galaxy Intersectoral Government, excluding the CGIG Core Exclusion Zone</li>

                    <li>Regions of Sectors 4 and 2 under the control of the GNR</li>
                    
                    <li>In Sector 7, excluding S7S Autonomous Space, as STARLINE SECTOR 7.</li>

                    Q: Why does STARLINE operate under STARLINE SECTOR 7 in Sector Seven?

                </p>

            <p class="a">

                A: Under the laws set out by the Sector Seven Regulatory commitee, STARLINE needs to abide by an extra set of laws and regulations while operating in Sector Seven. STARLINE SECTOR 7 is a subsidary of STARLINE that is able to follow the myriad regulations S7RC has set forth.

                STARLINE Industries and all of its subsidaries are legally forbidden from operating in the Sector Seven Science Autonomous Zone under the S7SAZ Corporate Regulations Act. Customers in the S7SAZ are encouraged to leave S7SAZ space via a shuttle service to receive service from STARLINE.
